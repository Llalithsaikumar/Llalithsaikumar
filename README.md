Hey there! 👋

I'm Lalith Sai, a Software Development Engineer (Fresher) based in India.

I build backend systems, write clean code, and enjoy turning ideas into working software.
If something breaks, I like debugging it until I understand *why* it broke.

My main focus is backend development with Python, REST APIs, and solid Data Structures & Algorithms.
I also contribute to open-source projects and enjoy collaborating through pull requests and code reviews.

I've worked on production APIs, optimized performance, and contributed merged changes to real-world codebases.
Some of my projects are pinned below.

Currently preparing for SDE / SDE Internship roles and building consistently.

Fun facts:
- I enjoy solving DSA problems and system bugs
- I like building things end-to-end
- Interests: backend engineering, open source, anime, fitness
